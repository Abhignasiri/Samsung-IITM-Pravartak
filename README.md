## ML models to predict Material Removal Rate

List of algorithms are performed on each dataset to compare their rmse, mae and r2 on normal and artificial data.

Algorithms performed are:
● Extra Trees 
● Linear Regression
● Decision Trees
● Random Forest Regressor
● KNN
● Gradient Boost
● XGBoost
● Neural Networks
● Lasso Regression
● Ridge Regression
● Support Vector Machine

Compared the prediction results of these ML models on different sets of training data and by generating synthetic data
